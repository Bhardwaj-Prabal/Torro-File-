# 🧩 Torro Split

### Torrent-Based Secure File System

**Torro Split** is an organization-focused file system that leverages a torrent-like approach to securely manage and distribute files. This system divides secure files into encrypted chunks, ensuring that data is assembled only upon request by an authorized company employee.

   - Files are split into multiple chunks.
   - Each chunk is encrypted individually.

2. **File Distribution:**
   - Chunks are distributed to various nodes.
   - Redundancy ensures chunks are duplicated for reliability.

3. **File Retrieval:**
   - Authorized users request file reassembly.
   - The system gathers and decrypts chunks, verifying access rights.
